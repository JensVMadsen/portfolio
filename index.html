My name is Jens and I'm an wind energy engineer with a passion for data science and AI. I'm currently doing my PhD at the Technical University of Denmark where I'm working with system engineering and optimization. This is my online portfolio which I'll use to showcase some of my current and finished work. I hope you will enjoy the content of the site!
